# Stencila VSCode Extension Demo

Welcome to the demo GitHub Codespace for the Stencila VSCode extension!

Please wait a few moments while VSCode installs the Stencila Plugin. You'll know it has completed when you see the Green and blue Stencila logo on this document's tab.

## Quick start

- The **Stencila Command Menu** can be accessed any time using `Ctrl`+`F1`, (`⌘-Fn-F1` on a Mac) or by clicking on the Stencila status bar item in the bottom right.

- Open the **Stencila Side Bar** using the Stencila icon in the activity bar on the far left. Use it to browse execution kernels, AI prompts and AI models, and click the action buttons to use them in the current document.

- To use Stencila's LLM assistant and AI model router, **Sign in to Stencila Cloud**, or enter a Stencila API token, via the Stencila Command Menu.

- **Explore** key functionality in detail, using the walkthroughs listed in the Stencila Command Menu.

- This file is a **Stencila Markdown Document** (*.smd).  Use the `Preview` button at the top right to view it and try running the examples below.
